           <br><br><br> <p> In that speech, she mentioned the values of hard work and respect that her parents tried to instill in her when she was younger. Former First Lady Michelle Obama described the same values, in a very similar way, in a speech she made in 2008, and the internet was quick to notice this after Melania Trump’s speech.

            </h3><br>    
            <p>
                J.K. Rowling is not the only author of a successful and popular book series to have been accused of plagiarism. J.R.R. Tolkien, author of The Lord of the Rings, has been accused of copying many ideas from Ring of the Nibelung, an opera composed by Richard Wagner.

                Tolkien has denied this claim, and many people are saying that the Wagner opera was simply used as an inspiration for his book series.
